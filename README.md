The model can classify 20 different types of caps <br/>
The types are following: <br/>
1. baseball cap
2. beanie cap
3. fedora cap
4. cowboy hat
5. kepi cap
6. flat cap
7. trucker cap
8. newsboy cap
9. pork pie hat
10. bowler hat
11. top hat
12. sun hat
13. boater hat
14. ivy cap
15. bucket hat
16. balaclava cap
17. turban cap
18. taqiyah cap
19. rasta cap
20. visor cap


## üìå Project Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Statement
Develop an AI-powered model to classify various types of caps from images.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection
- Used **DuckDuckGo** image search to collect images of **20 cap categories**.
- Automated image downloading with **FastAI‚Äôs `search_images_ddg` function**.
- Maintained a balanced dataset across all categories.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing
- Removed duplicate and irrelevant images.
- Standardized image size to **224x224 pixels**.
- Applied **data augmentation** (rotation, flipping, zoom, lighting adjustments) for robustness.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training
- Used **ResNet34** with **transfer learning**.
- Implemented **FastAI‚Äôs `cnn_learner`** for efficient training.
- Employed **cross-entropy loss** and **Adam optimizer**.
- Split dataset into **training and validation sets**.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation
- Achieved **94% accuracy** on the validation set.
- Analyzed misclassifications with a **confusion matrix**.
- Identified areas for improvement.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Model Deployment
- Exported model using `learner.export()`.
- Built an interactive **Gradio-based web interface**.
- Deployed the model on **Hugging Face Spaces**.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Future Improvements
- Expand dataset for better generalization.
- Experiment with **ResNet50 or EfficientNet** for higher accuracy.
- Implement **active learning** for dataset refinement.

## Data Collection and Preparation

### Data Collection
The dataset was collected from DuckDuckGo using cap category names as search terms, ensuring diverse images for training.

### DataLoader
The **fastai DataBlock API** was used to set up the `DataLoader`, organizing the data into training and validation sets.

### Data Augmentation
**fastai** provides default GPU-accelerated data augmentations, improving the model's generalization.

## Training, Data Cleaning, and Inference

### **Training**
The model was fine-tuned using **ResNet34** for 5 epochs, repeated 3 times, achieving an accuracy of approximately **89%**.

### **Data Cleaning**
Data cleaning was the most time-consuming part of the process. Since the data was collected from a browser, there was a significant amount of noise, and some images contained irrelevant content. To clean and update the dataset, I used the **fastai ImageClassifierCleaner**.

Data cleaning was performed after each training or fine-tuning session, except for the final iteration, which represented the final model.

### **Inference**
For inference, the trained model is used to classify new cap images. The **fastai Learner** was utilized to load the fine-tuned model and make predictions. This allows the model to classify unseen cap images accurately, based on the learned patterns during training.

## Model Deployment

The model was deployed to **HuggingFace Spaces** as a Gradio app. You can access the deployed app [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/fayez94/cap-recognizer_2).  
The implementation can be found in the `deployment` folder.

## API Integration with GitHub Pages

The deployed model API is integrated into a **GitHub Pages** website. You can view the integration [here](https://fayez94.github.io/Cap_Recognizer/docs/cap_recognizer.html).  
Implementation and other details are available in the `docs` folder.
